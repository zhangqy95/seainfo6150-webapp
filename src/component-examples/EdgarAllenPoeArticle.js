        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          <b>Edgar Allan Poe</b> (born Edgar Poe;
          <time datetime="1809-01-19">January 19, 1809</time> &ndash;
          <time datetime="1849-10-07">October 7, 1849</time>) was an American
          writer, editor, and literary critic. Poe is best known for his poetry
          and short stories, particularly his tales of mystery and the macabre.
          He is widely regarded as a central figure of Romanticism in the United
          States and of American literature as a whole, and he was one of the
          country's earliest practitioners of the short story. He is generally
          considered the inventor of the detective fiction genre and is further
          credited with contributing to the emerging genre of science fiction.
          <sup>1</sup> He was the first well-known American writer to earn a
          living through writing alone, resulting in a financially difficult
          life and career.<sup>1</sup>

        <h3>Early Life</h3>
        <p>
          Poe was born in Boston, the second child of actors David and Elizabeth
          "Eliza" Arnold Hopkins Poe.<sup>3</sup> His father abandoned the
          family in 1810, and his mother died the following year. Thus orphaned,
          the child was taken in by John and Frances Allan of Richmond,
          Virginia. They never formally adopted him, but he was with them well
          into young adulthood. Tension developed later as John Allan and Edgar
          Poe repeatedly clashed over debts, including those incurred by
          gambling, and the cost of Poe's secondary education. He attended the
          University of Virginia but left after a year due to lack of money.
          Edgar Poe quarreled with John Allan over the funds for his education
          and enlisted in the Army in 1827 under an assumed name,{" "}
          <s>Edward J. Crumplestiltskin</s> (this has been debunked, see{" "}
          <sup>3</sup>)

        <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p>
          It was at this time that his publishing career began with the
          anonymous collection <i>Tamerlane and Other Poems</i> (
          <time datetime="1827">1827</time>), credited only to "a Bostonian".
          Edgar Poe and John Allan reached a temporary rapprochement after the
          death of Frances Allan in 1829. Poe later failed as an officer cadet
          at West Point, declaring a firm wish to be a poet and writer, and he
          ultimately parted ways with John Allan. Poe switched his focus to
          prose and spent the next several years working for literary journals
          and periodicals, becoming known for his own style of literary
          criticism. His work forced him to move among several cities, including
          Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York City. He married his 13-year-old
          cousin, Virginia Clemm, in 1836. In January 1845, Poe published his
          poem "The Raven" to instant success, but Virginia died of tuberculosis
          two years after its publication. Poe planned for years to produce his
          own journal <i>The Penn</i>(later renamed <i>The Stylus</i>), but he
          died before it could be produced.

          <h4>The Raven</h4>
          <p>
            Poe's most famous work is "The Raven". Here is the first stanza:
          </p>
          <blockquote cite="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48860/the-raven">
            Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
            <br />
            Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
            <br />
            While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
            <br />
            As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
            <br />
            “’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
            <br />
            Only this and nothing more.”

          <h4>Invented words</h4>
          <p>
            Poe, like Shakespeare, invented a number of words in his writing.
            Here is a list of words and their definitions:
          </p>

            <dt>Frumulous</dt>
            <dd>Interesting or fascinating</dd>

        <h3>Death</h3>
        <p>
          On <time datetime="1849-10-03">October 3, 1849</time>, Poe was found
          delirious on the streets of Baltimore,
          <q cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe">
            in great distress, and... in need of immediate assistance
          </q>
          , according to Joseph W. Walker who found him.<sup>5</sup> He was
          taken to the Washington Medical College where he died on
          <time datetime="1849-10-07T09:00:00.000Z">
            Sunday, October 7, 1849 at 5:00 in the morning
          </time>
          .<sup>6</sup> He was not coherent long enough to explain how he came
          to be in his dire condition and, oddly, was wearing clothes that were
          not his own. He is said to have repeatedly called out the name
          "Reynolds" on the night before his death, though it is unclear to whom
          he was referring. Some sources say that Poe's final words were{" "}
          <q>
            Lord help my poor <em>soul</em>
          </q>
          .<sup>7</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          All medical records have been lost, including his death certificate.
          Newspapers at the time reported Poe's death as "congestion of the
          brain" or "cerebral inflammation", common euphemisms for death from
          disreputable causes such as alcoholism. The actual cause of death
          remains a mystery. Speculation has included delirium tremens, heart
          disease, epilepsy, chemical poisoning (large traces of C​<sub>8​</sub>
          H​<sub>10​</sub>N​<sub>4​</sub>O​<sub>2</sub> were found in Poe's
          bloodstream), syphilis, meningeal inflammation, cholera, and rabies.

        <h3>Legacy</h3>
        <p>
          Poe and his works influenced literature around the world, as well as
          specialized fields such as cosmology and cryptography. He and his work
          appear throughout popular culture in literature, music, films, and
          television. A number of his homes are dedicated museums today. The
          Mystery Writers of America present an annual award known as the Edgar
          Award for distinguished work in the mystery genre.
